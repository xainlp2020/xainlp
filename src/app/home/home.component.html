        <p><span><b>Goal:</b></span> This survey aims to demonstrate the recent  advances of XAI research in NLP, rather than to provide an exhaustive list of XAI papers in the NLP community. 
          To this end, we identified relevant papers published in major NLP conferences (ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and COLING) between 2013 and 2019 (papers after 2019 are also in our
          pipeline).
        </p>
          
        <p><span><b>Search criteria for XAI papers for NLP:</b></span>
          We filtered for titles containing (lemma-tized) terms related to XAI, such as “explainability”, “interpretability”, “transparent”, etc.  
          While this may ignore some related papers, we argue that representative papers are more likely to include such terms in their titles. In particular, 
          we assume that if authors consider explainability to be a majorcomponent of their work, they are more likely touse related keywords in the title of their work.</p>
        <p>Our search criteria yielded a set of 107 papers. During the paper review process we first verified whether each paper truly fell within the scope of the survey. 
          This process excluded 56 papers, leaving us with a total of <b>51</b> papers (by the end of 2019). The following tables reveals the top 3 NLP topics that these papers
        study and top 3 conference venues that they were published.</p>

          <p><span><b>Reviewing methodology:</b></span>
          Each paper was then classified across four major aspects: <i>explainability</i>, <i>operations to enable explainability</i>, <i>visualization</i>, and <i>evaluation metrics</i>.
          To ensure a consistent classification, each paper was individually reviewed by at least two reviewers, consulting additional reviewers in the case of disagreement. 
          For simplicity of presentation, we labe leach paper with its main applicable category for each aspect. However, some papers may span multiple categories within an aspect, 
          though usually with varying degrees of emphasis. We include all relevant categories for every paper in website, with the goal of enablingthe readers of this survey to discover 
          interesting explainability techniques and ideas, even if they have not been fully developed in the respective publications.
